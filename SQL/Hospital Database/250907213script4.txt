DELETE FROM doctor WHERE specialty = 'Surgeon'; -- Reason why the above command will give an error is because when we made head_doctor in the hospital table as the foriegn key to doctor_id we did not specify what would happen when it was deleted such as "ON DELETE SET NULL" or "ON DELETE CASCADE" and thus a doctor who is in the head_doctor fields cannot be deleted
-- In order to delete a head doctor you must set the head_doctor to NULL for the specific doctor you are trying to delete in the hospital table
